You can generate a react app with typscript by following the directions here: [Generate a React app with typescript instructions](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript)

```
npx create-react-app my-app --typescript
```

After generating the react application, it should have a README.md with instructions on how to run and test the app. (Also after you create the app, various commands will be displayed in the terminal)

Congratulations on a react-typescript application

A few things to try:

Go to the root directory of react app and start it
Next navigate to src/App.tsx
Try editing some of the text, save the file, and your change should be automatically reflected in the ui

After generating the project and making some modifications, checkout the branch `stateful-and-stateless`
